<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>Welcome to the Servlet Example as described in chapter 6. This is a simple example 
intended to introduce you to many of the concepts required to build and end-to-end fragment 
of a Web application that has dynamic content provided by servlets. The example is a simple 
list-detail of employess in the WASBOOK database. Press the link below to invoke the example. 
From the displayed page you can browse through the employess, click on the links on the 
employee ID, and see employee details, including address information. It is also possible 
to create new employees, delete employess, and update employee information.</P>
