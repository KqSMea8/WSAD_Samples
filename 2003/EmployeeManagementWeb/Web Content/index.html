<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>Welcome to the EJB Example as described in chapter 19. This is a simple example intended to 
introduce you to many of the concepts required to build an end-to-end fragment of a Web application 
that has dynamic content provided by JavaServer Pages and a Session EJB. The example is a simple list-detail of 
employees in the EJBBOOK database used in chapter 16. Press the link below to invoke the example. 
From the displayed page you can browse through the employees, click on the links on the employee 
ID, and see employee details, including address information. It is also possible to create new employees, delete employees, 
and update employee information.</P>
<P>For further details, see chapter 12.</P>
