<P>Welcome to the JSP Example as described in Chapter 11. This is a simple example intended to 
introduce you to many of the concepts required to build an end-to-end fragment of a Web application 
that has dynamic content provided by Java Server Pages. The example is a simple list-detail of employees 
in the EJPBOOK database. Press the link below to invoke the example. From the displayed page you can 
browse through the employees, click on the links on the employee ID, and see employee details, 
including address information. It is also possible to create new employees, delete employees, 
and update employee information.</P>
<P>For further details, see chapter 11.</P>
